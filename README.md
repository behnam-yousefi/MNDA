# Multiplex Network Differential Analysis (MNDA)

The aim of the current script:
To find genes whose local neighbourhood changes from one condition to the other (i.e. case-control, time point1-time point2, etc.)


We aim at unifying the MNDA pipeline for differnt problems

1) two-layer network case
2) multi-layer network case each layer with different condition
3) multi-layer network case some as case 1 and some as case 2 ...

In all cases, the code will be similar until the distance calculation

Note: The network structures are the same but their weights are different
