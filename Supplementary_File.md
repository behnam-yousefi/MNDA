## 1. Methods overview

MNDA+ is a computational tool for Multiplex Network Differential Analysis that operates on multiplex networks to detect nodes whose neighborhoods have significant variations across plexes. The core of the tool consists of three steps:

1.	representing the nodes of all network layers into a common embedding space (using an encoder decoder neural network - EDNN);
2.	calculating the distance between multiplex corresponding nodes (e.g. genes in biological networks);
3.	detecting the nodes whose neighborhoods vary significantly based on statistical testing (using permuted graphs).

The EDNN is composed of shallow encoder-decoder neural networks with the number of inputs and outputs being equal to the number of nodes in one layer (the nodes are the same from one layer to the other). For each node, the encoder input is a vector of its connection weights with the other nodes. If no link exists between two nodes, the corresponding input is set to zero. The decoder output for each node is a vector of node visit probabilities calculated based on a repeated fixed-length weighted random walk algorithm (Yousefi et al., 2023). The bottleneck layer serves as an embedding space in which dissimilarity between corresponding nodes are computed. The default dissimilarity measure implemented in the *mnda* R package is the cosine-distance. For technical details and motivations for parameter settings related to steps 1 and 2, we refer to (Yousefi et al., 2023). 

Step 3. involves assessing the significance of the calculated dissimilarities between corresponding nodes. Currently, the MNDA+ accommodates the following biological network analysis scenarios:

a.	Given two groups of samples corresponding to two conditions (e.g. independent healthy-diseased, male-female) and group-level biological networks $N_{C1}(V_{C1}, E_{C1})$ and $N_{C2}(V_{C2}, E_{C2})$ for each condition, form pairs of corresponding nodes ( $n_{1j}$ , $n_{2j}$ ); $n_{ij}$ is a node of $N_{Ci}$ , $i=1,2$ and $j$ runs from $1$ to the cardinality of $V_{Ci}$. 

b.	Given a single group of samples, for which two states are available $S_1$ and $S_2$ (e.g. matched case-control pairs, pre-post treatment for the same sample) and sample-level biological networks $N_{k,S_1}$ and $N_{k,S_2}$ for each state and individual $k$, form pairs of corresponding nodes ( $n_{k,1j}$ , $n_{k,2j}$ ); $n_{k,ij}$ is a node of $N_{k,S_i}$ , $i=1,2$ and $j$ runs from $1$ to the cardinality of each network (all networks are assumed to have the same node cardinality). 

Whereas in context *a.* only one vector of dissimilarities is created with a length corresponding to the number of nodes in the group-level biological networks, in context *b.* â€“ the scenario of sample-specific or individual-specific networks - multiple such vectors are created, one for each sample. In both contexts, an empirical null distribution of the chosen dissimilarity statistic is computed by reshuffling edges in the available networks (2 in scenario *a.* and 2 times the number of matched sample pairs in scenario *b.*). The user can specify whether to keep the node degree distribution intact for each network. Raw *P-values* thus obtained for each node annotation (corresponding nodes in a node pair have the same annotation) can or cannot be adjusted for multiple testing. For scenario *a.* as many tests as the cardinality of $V_{C1}$  ( $V_{C2}$ ) are carried out. In context *b.* the number of tests corresponds to the total number of nodes across samples for a single state. *Bonferroni* correction is the default option and the user can opt for less conservative correction methods.

An extra feature of the MNDA+ builds on scenario *b.* and allows testing differences between vectors of node dissimilarities (one vector for each sample) according to an extraneous factor (for instance, male/female). Although a multivariate  (non-parametric) ANOVA is theoretically possible, it is not to be recommended as the multiplicity in the multivariate response is driven by the number of nodes in a sample-level network. This number often runs in the tens of thousands. Therefore MNDA+ implements a two-group comparison test per node annotation. Hence, a multiple-testing correction involves adjusting raw *P-values* to as many tests as there are nodes in a sample-specific network. 

## 2. Implementation in R
### 2.1. Installation
Install from CRAN
`````{R}
install.packages("mnda")
`````
Install the latest version from GitHub
`````{R}
devtools::install_github("behnam-yousefi/MNDA/package/mnda")
`````
MNDA+ will also install TensorFlow and Keras for R, which need to be activated by installation of Miniconda. For this, according to the installation guidline of Keras ([here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/keras/vignettes/index.html)):
`````{R}
library(keras)
install_keras()
`````
This is only required once for the installation.

## 2.2. Apply on simulated networks
*MNDA+ pipeline for condition "a"*

To test the ```mnda``` package, a toy example multilayer network can be generated using the ```network_gen()``` function:
`````{R}
myNet = network_gen(N_nodes = 100, N_var_nodes = 5, N_var_nei = 90, noise_sd = .01)
`````
The process is described as the following:
1. two identical fully connected networks with ```N_nodes``` number of nodes and uniform random edge weights is generated.
2. a number of ```N_var_nodes``` nodes are randomly selected to have different edge weights with ```N_var_nei``` number of nodes (```N_var_nei``` $<$ ```N_nodes``` $- 1$) between the two networks.
3. a set of random Gaussian noise with zero mean and sd = ```noise_sd``` is generated and added to all of the edge weights.

The generated multiplex network and the set of the randomly selected nodes are accessible by the following lines, respectively.
`````{R}
graph_data = myNet$data_graph
var_nodes = myNet$var_nodes
`````
We then feed ```graph_data``` to the MNDA+ pipeline specialized for a two-layer multiplex network (condition *"a"*), which is composed of two commands:
`````{R}
embeddingSpaceList = mnda_embedding_2layer(graph_data, train.rep = 50)
mnda_output = mnda_node_detection_2layer(embeddingSpaceList)
print(mnda_output$high_var_nodes_index)
`````
the ```mnda_embedding_2layer()``` function represents all the nodes in a common embedding space (step 1); and the ```mnda_node_detection_2layer()``` function calculates the node-pair distances and assines a p-value to each node-pair (step 2 and 3). This process is repeated ```train.rep``` times to improve the robustness.

## 2.3. Usage Example 1: drug response  
*MNDA+ pipeline for condition "a"*

In this example, we construct gene coexpression networks (GCNs) for drug responders and non-responders. To this end, we use the PRISM dataset (Corsello et al., 2020), which is a cell line-based drug screening dataset. To reduce the dimensionality, 2000 genes that are highly variant across all the cell lines are selected and reposited. The gene expression profile of lung cancer cell lines as ```X``` and a binary vector of their response to the Tamoxifen drug as ```y``` can be loaded accordingly:
`````{R}
data = readRDS("Data/GCN2Layer_data_lung_tamoxifen_2000genes.rds")
X = data[[1]]
y = data[[2]]
`````
Next, we construct adjacency matrices of GCN for each condition,
`````{R}
adj_res = abs(cor(X[y=="res",]))
adj_nonres = abs(cor(X[y=="non_res",]))
diag(adj_res) = 0
diag(adj_nonres) = 0
`````
and convert them to the ```mnda``` multiplex network format.
`````{R}
adj_list = list(adj_res, adj_nonres)
graph_data = as.mnda.graph(adj_list, outcome = c("res","non_res"))
`````
Now we can call the MNDA+ pipeline as in the previous example
`````{R}
embeddingSpaceList = mnda_embedding_2layer(graph_data, edge.threshold = .1, train.rep = 50, epochs = 20, batch.size = 10, random.walk = FALSE, null.perm = FALSE)
mnda_output = mnda_node_detection_2layer(embeddingSpaceList, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
Nodes = mnda_output$high_var_nodes
`````
**hints for large networks:** 
* the random walk algorithm can be disabled by ```random.walk = FALSE``` for the sake of running time;
* the network permutation and representation can be disabled by ```null.perm = FALSE``` for the sake of running time;
* the calculated p-values can be adjusted by setting a method in the ```p.adjust.method``` argument.

## 2.4. Usage Example 2: application on individual specific networks
*MNDA+ pipeline for condition "b"*

In this example we use the data of Milieu Interieur project (Thomas et al., 2015; Piasecka et al., 2018), where immune transcriptional profiles of bacterial-, fungal-, and viral-induced blood samples in an age- and sex-balanced cohort of 1,000 healthy individuals are generated. Here, the aim would be to find genes whose neighborhood significantly varies between the two conditions of stimulated and unstimulated. Following the MNDA+ pipeline, we first construct a set of paired ISNs for the two conditions, i.e before stimulation and after treatment using the *lionessR* R package (Marieke Lydia Kuijjer et al., 2019; Marieke L. Kuijjer et al., 2019). In each network, nodes represent genes and the edge weights demonstrate the correlation of gene expression. The imputed ISNs are reposited in ```"usage_examples/Data/ISN_net.rds"```. We first read the ISN data creat the node list.
`````{R}
data = data.frame(readRDS("Data/ISN_net.rds"))
nodeList = t(sapply(rownames(data), function(x) strsplit(x,"_")[[1]]))
`````
Next, we create the individual variable data frame with three columns: Individual IDs (indecis), stimulation condition, sex (F,M).
`````{R}
y = colnames(data)
y = data.frame(t(data.frame(strsplit(y, "_"))))
`````
We then form the ```graph_data``` and call ```mnda_embedding()``` function to embed genes into the embedding space.
`````{R}
graph_data = cbind(nodeList, data)
embeddingSpaceList = mnda_embedding(graph_data, outcome = y[,2], indv.index = y[,1],train.rep=2, walk.rep=10, epochs=5, batch.size=100,random.walk=FALSE)
`````
For each individual-gene pair, we calculate the embedding distance between the nodes corresponding to before and after stimulation using ```mnda_node_distance()```. This results in distance matrices of *individual-by-gene*. Finally, we test the association of sex with the distance of each gene using ```mnda_distance_test_isn()```.
`````{R}
Dist = mnda_node_distance(embeddingSpaceList)
Pval = mnda_distance_test_isn(Dist, rep(c(1,2),25))
`````
