## Obtaining the embedding space using EDNN (e.g. run MNDA_2LayerNet.R),
## where the nodes in all the layers of the network are mapped to a same space,
## one can be stratify these nodes into some clusters to analyse neighborhood transitions.

## The input to this script is a list of embedding spaces (e.g. embeddingSpaceList)
embeddingSpaceList = readRDS("Data/Embedding_Space/Embedding_Space_1.rds")
